# StructuRe

A tiny package to parse STRUCTURE data to obtain the Q matrix, and then to plot the results.

First, parse the data: `parsed_struct <- parseStructure(/path/to/file/)`\
Then, plot the data: `plot(parsed_struct)`\

I acknowledge https://github.com/nicholasmason/parseStructure for the inspiration and have modified their code.
